Description: A compositional statistical framework for absolute proportion 
    estimation between fractions in RNA sequencing data. FracFixR addresses 
    the fundamental challenge in fractionated RNA-seq experiments where library 
    preparation and sequencing depth obscure the original proportions of RNA 
    fractions. It reconstructs original fraction proportions using non-negative 
    linear regression, estimates the "lost" unrecoverable fraction, corrects 
    individual transcript frequencies, and performs differential proportion 
    testing between conditions. Supports any RNA fractionation protocol including
    polysome profiling, sub-cellular localization, and RNA-protein complex isolation.
